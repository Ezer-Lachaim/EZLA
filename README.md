## Development

This is a monorepo using npm workspaces

### Git Branches
Currently, we have 2 main branches:
- `master` - The system is available only for the sick
- `feat/open-to-all` - The system is available for everyone because of the current situation

When pushing your changes, please make sure to push to the correct branch.
If it is a bugfix, or a feature that is relevant to both situations, please open the PR to `master` branch.
On the other hand, if it is a feature that is relevant only for the current situation, please open the PR to `feat/open-to-all` branch.

If you are unsure, please ask in the Google Spaces chatroom.
